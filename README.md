# Calculate Length Two Points CS

## Problem Description
Create an app to calculate length of 2 points in cartean system

## Dev Environtment Setup
- In this usecase we use replit and we ecnourage you to use replit so your system will same with us

## How to run test
- Click section `Unit tests` and then
- Click button `Run Test`

## Build Instructions
none because this is library

## Run Instructions
- Fork this repo to your replit account
- If you don't have any java file, make a new one.
- Make a new object of CalculateTheLengthOfTwoPoints (i.e) `CalculateTheLengthOfTwoPoints cl = new CalculateTheLengthOfTwoPoints();` in your created java file.
- Set your points `setX1()`,  `setY1()`,  `setX2()`,  `setY1()`. After you set it you can calculate with `calculateLength()` method. 
- If you want to change point, you can chagne it with re set your point and then calculate again with `calculateLength()`
- Heres a description of methods that can be use with this class

| Method  |  Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| setX1(double num)  | Set x of first point |
| setY1(double num)  | Set y of first point |
| setX2(double num)  | Set x of second point |
| setY2(double num)  | Set y of second point |
| calculateLength  | Return a float number of length from two points() |
