# Calculate Length Two Points CS

## Problem Description
Create a library to calculate length of 2 points in cartesian system

## Dev Environtment Setup
- In this usecase we use replit and we ecnourage you to use replit so your system will same with us

## How to run test
- Click section `Unit tests` and then
- Click button `Run Test`

## Build Instructions
none because this is library

## Run Instructions
### Just Run It
- Fork this repo to your replit account. 
- Then click run to run the app
### Use our library
- If you want to implement this library in your java file, make a java file first.
-Then make a new object of CalculateTheLengthOfTwoPoints (i.e) `CartesianSystem cs = new CartesianSystem();` in your created java file.
- Set your points `setCoordinateX1()`,  `setCoordinateY1()`,  `setCoordinateX2()`,  `setCoordinateY1()`. After you set it you can calculate with `calculateLength()` method. 
- If you want to change point, you can chagne it with re set your point and then calculate again with `calculateLength()`
- Heres a description of methods that can be use with this class

| Method  |  Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| setCoordinateX1(double num)  | Set x of first point |
| setCoordinateY1(double num)  | Set y of first point |
| setCoordinateX2(double num)  | Set x of second point |
| setCoordinateY2(double num)  | Set y of second point |
| calculateLength () | Return a float number of length from two points |
